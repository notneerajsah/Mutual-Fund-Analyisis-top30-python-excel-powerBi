# ðŸ“Š Mutual Fund Analysis & Visualization

This project highlights how data science and visualization can be combined to **discover the best-performing mutual fund schemes** with a balance of **returns and risk**.

 **Technologies Used:** Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn), MS Excel, Power BI
 **Dataset Size:** 2500+ mutual fund schemes â†’ filtered to **Top 30 funds**

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To analyze a large mutual fund dataset, apply **data-driven ranking techniques**, and showcase insights through an **interactive Power BI dashboard**, making investment choices easier and smarter.

##  Python Data Workflow

I began with raw data containing 2500+ schemes and applied a systematic pipeline in Python.

### Step 1: Cleaning & Preparation

* Dropped irrelevant fields
* Handled blanks and inconsistencies
* Converted numeric columns (returns, AUM, expense ratio) into proper formats

### Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis

* Summary statistics: mean, median, range, standard deviation
* Distribution analysis across fund type, risk grade, and age

### Step 3: Normalization

* Applied **MinMaxScaler** to bring all metrics onto a comparable scale
* Ensured fair comparison between high-return and low-cost funds

### Step 4: Scoring & Ranking Model

Ranking formula considered:

* Strong 3-year returns
* Reasonable expense ratio
* Stable track record with 1Y positive return
* Moderate fund age (not too new, not too old)

### Step 5: Top 30 Funds

Final list of top 30 funds exported for further analysis.
